```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
head(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
```
The variables in this dataset includes `r names(penguins)`. The dataset contains data for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins. The mean for the flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm=TRUE)`.

```{r scatterplot}
ggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=flipper_length_mm))+geom_point(aes(color=species))
```

```{r Q2}
df=tibble(
  norm_samp=rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_log=norm_samp>0,
  x=as.character(norm_samp),
  y=factor(x,3)
)

```

The mean of the norm_sample is `r mean(pull(df, norm_samp))`.
The mean of the norm_sample_log is `r mean(pull(df,norm_samp_log))`.
The mean of the characters is `r mean(pull(df,x))`.
The mean of the factors is `r mean(pull(df,y))`.

```{r convert}
x_convert=as.numeric(df$x)
y_convert=as.numeric(df$y)
```
The mean for the new x variables is `r mean(x_convert)`.
The mean for the new y variables is `r mean(y_convert)`. This suggests that character and factor vectors cannot compute the mean, it could only be computed when it is converted to numeric values.
